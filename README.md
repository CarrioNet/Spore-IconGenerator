# Spore-IconGenerator
A super quick and easy to use mod which creates a custom category with 40 empty pages, each one can store a part for generating high resolution part icons.

To use, make sure you download the package and drop it into Spore's dataEP1 folder along with the other packages lurking there. After which you can modify the items in the super handy [SporeModder FX](https://emd4600.github.io/SporeModder-FX/ "SporeModder FX") tool. 

Contains a python script to reset the page files as well so you don't have to manually go through each one to clear them out, and can be modified to change how many template files you want to generate. 

Be sure to take a look at [emd4600's part icon tutorial](https://github.com/emd4600/SporeModder-FX/wiki/How-to:-Generate-perfect-part-thumbnails "How to: Generate perfect part thumbnails") for the specifics and the console command.

Requires the [ModCreatorKit](https://github.com/emd4600/Spore-ModAPI/tree/master/Projects/Example%20Projects/ModCreatorKit#modcreatorkit "ModCreatorKit") and the [Spore ModAPI Launcher](http://davoonline.com/sporemodder/rob55rod/ModAPI/Public/ "Spore ModAPI Launcher") and obviously the above mentioned SporeModder FX tool.
